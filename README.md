Predictive Modeling with Decision Trees and Random Forests
This repository contains Python code for predictive modeling using Decision Trees and Random Forests, applied to a real estate dataset (train.csv) containing housing prices from Iowa. The goal is to predict house prices (SalePrice) based on various features such as lot area, year built, and number of rooms.

Steps and Explanation: Loading Data:
We start by loading the dataset (train.csv) using the Pandas library. This dataset contains information about houses, including features like lot area, year built, and sale price.

Splitting Data:
We split the data into features (X) and target (y) variables. Features include lot area, year built, etc., while the target variable is the sale price. Further, we split the data into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. This allows us to evaluate our models on unseen data.

Decision Tree Model:
We first build a Decision Tree Regression model without specifying any hyperparameters. This is done using DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree. We make predictions on the validation set and calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the model's performance.

Tuning Decision Tree Model:
Next, we tune the Decision Tree model by specifying the max_leaf_nodes hyperparameter. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization. We again make predictions on the validation set and calculate the MAE to compare it with the untuned model.

Random Forest Model:
We then implement a Random Forest Regression model using RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy. We fit the Random Forest model to the training data and make predictions on the validation set.

Evaluating Random Forest Model:
Finally, we calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) for the Random Forest model on the validation set to assess its performance. Setup: To run this code, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn).

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

Copy code pip install pandas scikit-learn
